<!--
*when we keep variable in block scope then we cannot access that variable in global scope and it will givve output as reference error
*it is function scoped
*In let we can reassign the value and we will get output as reassigned value.
*In let we cannot redeclare the value if we do this we get output as syntax error where identifier is already declared
*In this the hoisting is not done.because the values will be hoisted but it will be left as unintialized.
